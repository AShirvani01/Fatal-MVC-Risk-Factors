# Fatal Motor Vehicle Collision Risk Factors in Toronto, ON

## Project Overview
This respository contains a modified version of my final project for STA303: Methods of Data Analysis II at the University of Toronto.

The goal of this analysis is to identify risk factors associated with fatal Motor Vehicle Collisions (MVCs) in Toronto, Canada. This analysis is intended to inform the average person of the most important factors to take into consideration, to ultimately help guide the individual to take the necessary precautions to reduce their likelihood of dying in a MVC.
